Nice little Google helper.

It lets you rearrange the top bar you see on most google sites, such as gmail, calendar,  docs.

I also added links that aren't available such as google voice.

I'll push this out to the Google extension gallery later in the week.

I didn't test this on every Google app, mainly because is Google and they have a lot of apps :-p but this should work in the more common ones.

!!TODO:
 - It'll be nice to add custom links options. So users can add quicklinks to the top menu bar
